1. use collapsible list on elements (reactstrap collapse?)
    - use hooks, needs to change to function components
    -read up promises, axios, setstate, asynchronous/synchronous
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54261535/cant-get-react-component-to-update-after-setting-state-after-axios-call

2. eventually add batch add/delete/edits and save button instead of constantly posting/getting for each item

Note: able to make request with filter with "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/lists/?title=title2"
    Need to find out how to filter by null for parent_list. Also see if we can have multiple filters on single view
